I made it!!! 

What a journey, seriously, looking back on it right now is a pretty cool feeling. I don't know if I've ever learned so much within a 5 month time period in my whole life and even though it was exhausting both working and doing this program, I think it was one of the better choices I've ever made. 

What's equally exciting as how much I've learned is how much more there is to learn, that is one of the innate things about this field I love so much, along with the nonstop problem solving, the infinite amount more there is to learn and always will be. I already have a list of topics and ideas I want to start tackling in the near future, and it's thanks to this program that I feel like I have the understanding continue my learnings thanks to what I feel like is a true understanding of code and its development.

Anyways, I just had to get that out haha on to the my experiences with the final project, which were a whole journey in themselves. 

My idea for the final project was a scheduler where you could create a schedule and it showed how you were allocating your time in some visually unique way. I wanted to give time a more tangible feel to it when you were building out a schedule along with being able to reflect on that schedule. Looking back on it, it makes a lot of sense that this is the idea I chose. I used to be a busy student-athlete in college where you have every hour of your day mapped out for you, to doing pharmaceutical sales, where you have a lot of freedom over your schedule, tack on balancing this program, friends, family, dog, hobbies, etc... and my biggest pet peeve being inefficient time usage, and this application is what you get haha.

As I feel like has been a theme in my posts is that I tend to go through all my biggest mistakes and obstacles with the hopes that any of you reading this while going through the program can avoid them :) 

Alright, so I had my idea, and went to follow an article on building the react app with rails api. I'm not sure if it was linked to on the final project page or how I got to it but this was personally my biggest mistake! This article had you building out the front and back end in the same folder and downloading files that allowed you to use the same local server url. 

Though I feel like I could easily tackle this now and is very useful, this crippled me at the time, drastically. I had started down this path and built out a lot of the files only to end up scraping the whole thing and starting over. Like 2 days worth of stuff, scrapped. 

I don't know if it was because I had just come out of the react/redux section and hadn't thought about rails in a sec, or if cuz I was tring to be a little too ambitious with my project at the start, but it just felt like there was too much going on.

My solution, and my advice, is to start small and pragmatically. I looked up another article on building a react app with rails api, and this one had you create two completely different projects, one being the api, and one being the react-app. This was huge for me!!!! One of those clicking moments you know? Just visualizing it as two seperate entities, which they are, is what I would recommend. Then the article goes on to setting up the connection between them. Most of the same stuff as the first article but just soooooo much easier to digest and understand. 

As a trial run to make sure everything was working as it should, I built out a simple little CRUD list app. Now at this point, with this simple little app, the relationships between everything we had learned, Ruby, Rails, JS, SQL, CSS, HTML, React, Redux, were so clear and visible within this simple app. And now I this was a platform I could build upon. So I used the same foundation and started building out my app. 

And mistake number 2... I was looking for html/css structure for a simple schedule when I fell in love with a schedule style I found online. It was exactly what I envisioned for my schedule but it was not meant for react/redux, and I spent wayyyy too long converting as much functionality and style as I could into my project, and even once I had the look integrated, it led to more problems. I even knew I should get rid of it after pouring hours into it but my stubborness previaled when I wish it wouldn't have.  I could've even just npm installed simple ones of used googles, i mean come on! I'm still kicking myself for doing this. Start simple, and add style and functionality from there. And don't get too attached to an idea. There's always other solutions.

After those two big mistakes, it was honestly smooth sailing, this program does a great job at teaching you. And at this point you will be capable of solving almost any problem you run into by doing some extra research online. Stack overflow and all the guides and docs are now my best friends. I actually plan on reading through them for fun lol

And thats it! Final project done and can't wait to keep learning.
