I just finished my final project in the program and submitted everything and all I have to say is... Wow. Few things in the world are better than when you pour your effort and time into something, grinding away day in and day out, to finally pick your head up and see what you've accomplished. Right now it's up there with that feeling I had when I landed that first good job out of college, or getting that scholarship you worked so hard for, or finally winning that nat'l championship after a lifetime of blood, sweat, and tears poured into it. It's moments like this that keep you going.

In looking back on all I've learned, it's difficult for me to pick a technical topic out of everything. So, I figured I'd give some advice! And that just seems to be the way most of my posts go, recapping my biggest mistakes in each project so someone else doesn't have to make them. I'll probably start a seperate technical blog focusing on a single specialty here soon, or maybe transition this one into it, we'll see. Anyways, here is my advice for anyone in the Flatiron Online Program or about to start it!

1. Have fun!! - Seriously, this thing is fun. Yeah it's a lot of work and you'll get frustrated at points, but each lesson or lab is a new problem to solve, another level to beat! And know that getting through the hardest sticking points are where you learn the most so smile through the pain.

2. Trust the process - Looking back on it I think this curriculum is brilliantly put together. Every lesson is valuable, and even when you are grinding through the topics and you know that there is an easier way to do it, or it even tells you that there is at points, stay focused on learning that lesson! They don't put it in there for nothing. This program builds your knowledge of coding from the ground up, with a very strong foundation, and that becomes so extremely useful when you are teaching yourself and solving problems for the projects. I feel like I have the understanding to tackle any topic now and its all due to that.

3. Make yourself a schedule - Set aside time each day. Consistency is huge when learning a new topic like this. Try to not be that person that does 20 hours straight one day and then doesn't put in any time the next 3 days. Yeah you might make it through but it's just like that person in school who pulled the all nighter right before that exam compared to the student who studied every night. They might get similar grades on that test, but the retention rate for the inconsistent studier is sooo much lower and studies prove it. So when the final comes around, then he's SOL. Don't be him when this is a skill you want to pursue a career in.

4. Think like a programmer/immerse yourself - They talk about how "programming is a way of thinking" a bunch at the beginning of the curriculum, by the end I guess it's just assumed you do haha. But if you are in the program you will start to notice a change in the way you think and it will help you a lot as you progress. The program builds you up to that point but one of the best ways to help or speed this up is immerse yourself. After a couple weeks in I actually took a week off of work so I could truly immerse myself in it and I felt the shift. It's like that phenomenon where if you engulf yourself in another language enough you'll start to dream in that language. 

5. Start small with projects - I don't mean this as shoot small and make unambitious projects, the way you learn is by pushing yourself! Go big or go home. What I mean is when you get to a project section they pretty much take the reigns off. You are allowed to go as big as you want and it's easy to get really ambitious with it and that's good, be creative. But along with the reigns coming off at the project section, you are also going to be exposed to things you haven't been before because you've been under the protection of all the nice labs they give you, with tests to guide you, and the IDE to keep you safe and warm. There's learning curves to be had with your terminal, understanding file structure, your text editor, and so much more! You'll spend days encountering miscellaneous problems once you have to ditch the learn IDE. But back to the point, start small so that you can get everything set up nice and easily and know its working, then build upon that foundation.

Good luck!
