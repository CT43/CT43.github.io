After learning about Ajax, API's, etc... I had to travel for work for two weeks with little to no time to code. Once I got back home, I dove back in and realized I was rusty, yeah I could probably squeeze through the rest of it and finish up the section, but then I realized just how important it was, too important to not have a full understanding, so I did it all again. 

Just think about it, we now live in a world where everything has to be instantaneous. If a page takes longer than a couple seconds to load, we press back. If a video doesn't load quick enough on instagram we keep scrolling, people are always looking for the faster, easier, more efficient option, this includes diets, making money, food, literally everything, and the internet bends to this rule as well. So in walked Ajax and the internet was never the same. 

The other component that convinced me to cover the section again was API's. Just as how there seems to be a natural law pushing the human population to anything that is faster and more efficent, another "law" to observe is that data now runs the modern world. Data gathering, manipulation, and interpretation has already changed our world than most people have the slightest clue of, and it will continue to do so. So I simply couldn't allow myself to leave this topic of API's without a full understanding. 

My feeling after completing this section? 

What a cool section. Seriously, this is some advanced stuff we are getting into and when you take a step back and look at the big picture, wow.

But alright, so on to my project, I was essentially enhancing my team task manager rails project by adding JS. Simple enough, I so naively thought. The way I planned out adding JS to the project was allowing the user to view their lists, sift through their lists, and update tasks to the lists dynamically. And what made the most sense to me from a UI standpoint was to build these out all inside of eachother. So from the list extension and sifting through the lists, it wasn't enough to just view the index or show resource but I had to use Ajax, JS, and Handlebars to dynamically render new forms, links, and other miscellaneous data, and allow those to also call more data from the controllers and database through ajax and js. If I'm being honest, at times it felt like I had bitten off more than I can chew, but I'm not one for backing down from a challenge and it ended up being so much fun. I mean problem solving is what I love most about all of this, so problem after problem I solved and out popped my project.
