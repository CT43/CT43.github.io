I just completed the Rails section and project and I feel like I belong in Hogwarts now more than ever lol. 

The phrase "rails magic" makes perfect sense to me now. Had this program not progressed me through in the way that it did, building up levels of understanding and abstraction, I would truly think that rails is magic. 

At first, rails was very difficult for me. I felt like jumping up this next layer of abstraction left some gaps in understanding. I guess the best way to put it would be that in the previous sections I felt like I had more control. Everything was laid out right in front of you and you told what to go where, and this attribute belonged to that, etc... Honestly, I liked that feeling, so having rails wrap so much of that up in abstraction made me uncomfortable at first. And it was very frustrating, especially when the tests are so specific and you are trying to figure out the argument order impacts of a form_for collection_select and figuring out which argument allows the test to read the id of the collection_select... 

Like yeah, that sucked haha

But I knew that just like with anything, practice makes perfect and that soon it will become second nature to me. Already by the end of the section project, I feel so much better. 

For my project I created a team task manager. It has your basic to-do list functionality for all users but allows users to be a part of a team and for there to be a hierarchical leadership structure within the team or group, where users that are the boss of others can add tasks to their employees and create new lists through team view, and view the uncompleted tasks, etc... https://github.com/CT43/team-task-manager

So rails is great, moral of the story.

On a side note, I see increasingly more scenarios of me "thinking like a programmer" every day. Just the other day I was doing my fantasy football draft with friends and in my preparation process I felt like I was writing out a program. "If x player was taken by draft spot y, draft z player, and if I drafted z player of position a, then draft player of best value from position b." As I was doing it I thought to myself that I could easily create a customized drafting program, and some day I just might! 

Anyways, it was awesome and I love all of this:)
