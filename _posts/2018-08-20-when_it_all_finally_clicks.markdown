There are few better feelings in the world than when your understanding of something finally "clicks". It's as if you have been working on a puzzle for weeks, going through the procedure of finding the corners and building inwards, and then, you find that piece that connects the sides, you finally see the picture and it all comes together in one split second. 

In this section I felt that "click" more than I ever have. 

Prior to this I went through the ruby section in just a few weeks and was on an extremely fast pace, everything clicking and working. Then I got to the beginning of the Sinatra section and it all came screeching to a halt. I went from doing 20-30 lessons and labs on some days down to 2-3. I was so fustrated and couldn't figure out why it seemed like every possible answer or explanation I had, just wasn't the right one. There were times I spent hours overthinking an error and re-doing the whole lab just to figure out I had mispelt the "id" value of an input tag... talk about infuriating haha 

But, just as with anything else in life, all you can do is keep pushing forward, so I kept on moving through, progressing at what seemed to me like a snail's pace. I became substantially better at debugging and reading error messages. This forced me to better understand the paths and relationships between various aspects of the file and the MVC. I made myself read source code and look up more tutorials. 

And then finally... it clicked! It was like night and day, all of a sudden it was like I was able to visualize how everything worked together. Between that and just the repitition of getting the syntax down, along with my vastly improved debugging skills, I feel as awesome  behind the keyboard as ever. 

But this competence I'm feeling might be short lived, as its on to the next topic!

p.s. If there was some advice I would give to myself in hindsight, it would've been to literally draw out the relationships in the MVC and then spend a ton of time in tux and shotgun with prys loaded everywhere inside a project or lab folder. If you are just starting the Sinatra section please do this for yourself! 

best, 

Christian
